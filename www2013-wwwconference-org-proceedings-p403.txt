 we use the term social annotations to refer to the presentation of social signals as explanations for why a search or recommendation result is being displayed. thus, a social signal only becomes an annotation when it is presented to the user. if so, users click on the result to examine the details. we planned 16-20 search tasks for each subject, at least eight of which were  social search" tasks designed to organically pull up results with social annotations.   talk me through how you carried out this search task. this result? each one of these eye-trace data for each task was analyzed by hand by an experimenter to understand how subjects performed the search task by formulating search queries; recording the search query used by the subject; which positions contained personal search results; whether the search result was in the  eld of view in the browser; and importantly, whether the subject  xated on the result and/or the social annotation. during the interviews, subjects mentioned uses for personalized search results. we are at the cusp of teaching users how to parse social search results by designing where and how the annotations will appear. after all, search engines are including social search results and its associated annotation only because of the belief that they will be useful to the users. as web users become more social, they bring their social context to search and they expect and demand search engines to make use of this social context.
