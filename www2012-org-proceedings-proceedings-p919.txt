 in an early experiment, we measured, for each personal name, the 10th and 90th percentiles of the dates of that name s occurrence in the news. for every name that appears in the input, we consider that name s timeline, which is the multiset of dates at which that name appears, including multiple occurrences within an article. (in both methods, a name whose fame begins monday and ends wednesday is considered to have a duration of two days.) we counted the total number of times each name appeared in each year (counting repeats within an article). the results are presented in figures 4 (for the news corpus) and 5 (for the blog corpus). rations as it changes over time. the respective distributions from the news corpus are superimposed for comparison.  duration of fame (days) the graphs of fame duration measured using the continuity method are much smoother for the blog corpus than for the news corpus. this happens because whereas we only know which day each news article was written, we know the time of day each blog entry was posted.
