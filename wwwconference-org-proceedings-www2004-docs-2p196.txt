 service n interface service n interface service descriptions choice quality assessment service providers service providers service 1 implementation service 1 implementation ... if no user-specific preferences are given with the service request, the relaxation follows the domain-specific conceptual views of the service ontology given by the service providers or portal operators. after a certain implementation has been chosen, the service provider will execute the service and deliver the result. this is determined by a relaxation step in the service ontology, i.e. a generalization of concepts along the lines of the ontology. a basic service ontology is depicted in figure 2. we introduce the notion of conceptual views on a service ontology to account for all the different interests a user wants to express in a service request. predicates let us consider our restaurant booking service from above. the relaxation of query predicates over such a view is straightforward. this problem will remain if more relaxation steps have to be taken.
