 then, the block features (including spatial features and content features) are extracted to represent the blocks. block importance should reflect the correlation degree between a block and the theme of the web page. a block importance model is a function to map from features to importance for each block, and can be formalized as: < block features  > block importance table 3: agreement on all kinds of 2-level importance levels (123),4 on the other hand, the contents in a block are also useful to judge block importance. with the segmentation of vips, each block is described by a rectangle located in the page. basically, there are two possible ways to deduce block importance from block features. when a page is loaded into the browser, the page is segmented first by the vips algorithm and then an importance value is calculated for each block based on the block importance model. web information retrieval may benefit from block importance in three aspects. with block importance, links can be differentiated naturally and assigned different weights so that page importance could be spread more precisely. another application of block importance is for web page classification [9][15][16].
