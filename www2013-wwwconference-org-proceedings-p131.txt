 how, then, can we build a machine learning system that predicts user demographics from query histories? here we show how facebook likes can be used to build a model predicting users  individual traits that can be later applied to search query data. there are two issues that need to be addressed to apply the model built on facebook likes to query histories.   we show how to use odp categories to match facebook likes with search queries. inferring user demographics. from query trends to global statistics. the feature values are normalized into probabilities so that they all sum to one for each user. bing query logs (search).  for each user trait used here, we  rst train a model on we then apply the same model on search queries and repeat the classi cation for search users. (top-right) the distribution of christians in the us as predicted based on user queries. at testing, each user   in facebook and search datasets   is compared against these models, and the one producing the highest probability is used for classi cation. (top-right) the distribution of agnostics in the us as predicted based on user queries.    = (10) from their search queries.
