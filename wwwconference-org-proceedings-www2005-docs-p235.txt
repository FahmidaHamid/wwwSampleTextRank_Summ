 this must be achieved while retaining the quality of the answers provided by the search engine to its users. we have found that the rankings produced by our method are more similar to the rankings generated without compression. in our study, we extended the method to perform experiments with phrase queries. in our method, we consider that two words are close if they appear in the same sentence. search engines usually provide rich query options to their users. for instance, google3 allows users to include query options like inserting phrases in the query or making a query term mandatory. to understand the impact of the proposed pruning method over each query type, we have experimented with all the three query types described above. for constructing the pools we have evaluated the (cid:12)rst top 20 answers of each ranking for each query. five compression rates were tested.
