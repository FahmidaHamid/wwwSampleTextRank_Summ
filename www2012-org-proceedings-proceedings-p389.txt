 recently, some richer methods of presenting query suggestions have been explored. given a query, its query cluster can be identi ed, and the other members of that cluster can be presented as query suggestions [4, each query suggestion was accompanied by information as to how many other people used that suggestion. the query suggestions for an alternative entity is shown only when that entity is clicked by the user. the query contexts are then used to capture new entity names. query logs are also used for mining search intents. finally, we classify query suggestions into the categories that are shared across entities in an entity cluster. from a query log, query contexts are obtained for each entity by replacing the occurrences of the entity in queries with a wild-card. we express this criterion as query suggestion entropy over categories. we select the query that maximizes the j , . they judged whether it makes sense to classify each query suggestion into the given category.
