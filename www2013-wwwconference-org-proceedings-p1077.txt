 however, both algorithms cannot handle an upper bound constraint on the team size. generalized team formation problem. up to our knowledge we are the  rst to integrate upper bound constraints, in particular on the size of the team, into the team formation problem. this constraint often applies as the team leader is usually  xed before forming the team. problem formulation. we now reformulate the team formation problem on the subgraph g . r2(f )    r2(f ). here we consider the team formation problem (gdsp) in its more general setting. here again all methods return the same team, which is indeed optimal since the lp bound agrees with the density of the obtained team. out of the three methods, only forte can solve this problem.
