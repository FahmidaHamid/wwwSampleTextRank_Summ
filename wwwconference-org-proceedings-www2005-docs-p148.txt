 2a, which assigns to an action a a set of actions which can be invoked by a. given a set of actions a, a consistency interface c is a partial function c : a ! a protocol interface p is a pair (d; f), where d : a ! in the rest of the paper, \protocol interface" stands for \well-formed protocol interface". (well-formed protocol interface) let us model the shop web service as a protocol interface. given interfaces we say p 0 re nes p (written p 0 4 p), if protocol two (substitutivity of protocol interfaces) consider the protocol interface pshop and the following protocol interface p 0 shop: given a protocol interface p = (d; f), the underlying consistency interface of p (denoted uci(p)) is the partial function c : a !
