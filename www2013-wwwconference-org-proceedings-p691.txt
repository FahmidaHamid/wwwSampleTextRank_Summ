 thus, we introduce not only a topic mixture model of generating the descriptions in the submitted articles, as the plsi model does, but also another topic model of producing the histories of digging and writing by each user, and apply both topic models into our probabilistic model. in our probabilistic model, we assume that every user writes the descriptions in his submissions according to his topic preference. in our model, when an article with a small digg score is dug by a user, we assume that the article has more similar topic relevance to the user s topic preference. if we want to use the ctr model for recommending digg articles, we can extend it by ignoring the digg scores and the descriptions posted by users. finally, we refer to a user ua   u to whom digg articles are recommended as an active user. since the digg articles with high scores have more chances to be shown to each user, if the article di has a high digg score si, the user ua tends to dig di with a higher probability than the digg articles with small digg scores in the formulation of exp-kl( (z|di);  /si,  (z|ua)). once the parameters   in our model are estimated, recommendations can be made by utilizing the model parameters. it recommends digg articles without considering each user s preference. then, we extract 100 diggings of each selected user randomly.
