 we achieve this by synthesizing models from the engineering disciplines of networks and user devices into an end-to-end model of energy consumption. they also assume the energy consumption by networks to be negligible. multiple models have been developed to estimate the energy consumption of all parts of the service system. examples include user devices [28][14], servers [8], data centers [2] and clouds [22]. as with any such model, there is uncertainty about the data values used. the energy footprint for the service is calculated as the sum over the energy consumption of the relevant subsystems involved in the delivery and consumption. the final source of energy consumption is the device used by the user to access the service. our model presented so far allows determining the energy footprint of a given user. the model we have presented in the paper is focused on the energy used to deliver a digital service.
