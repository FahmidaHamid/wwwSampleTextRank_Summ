 we call this network a target network. edge embeddedness. with our extracted features, the source and target graph edge instances can be represented in the same feature space.   src: using all edge instances in the source graph only for training.   target: using labeled edge instances in the target graph only for training. we vary the percentage of labeled edge instances in the target graph from 2% to 30% labeled target edge instances plus all source graph edges are used for training.  j
