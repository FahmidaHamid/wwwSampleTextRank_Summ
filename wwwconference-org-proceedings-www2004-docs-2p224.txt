 we transform the estimated weights as follows: top-100 user selection on them. we can see that the dht-based algorithm has better prediction accuracy than the traditional cf algorithm. we select 2000 users and choose one user as active user per time and the remainder users as his candidate neighbors, because every user only make self s recommendation locally. we use the mean prediction accuracy of all the 2000 users as the system's prediction accuracy. for every user s recommendation calculation, our tests are performed using 80% of the user s ratings for training, with the remainder for testing.
