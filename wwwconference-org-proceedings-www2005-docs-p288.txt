 [9] exploits xquery containment for query optimization. next we propose to employ three types of containment mappings for deriving the containment decision. that is, not all the variable binding dependencies are utilized in the query result. we conduct three types of containment mappings. each de(cid:12)ned variable is denoted by a var node v 2 v . a variable v may either be used for de(cid:12)ning another variable or in a return expression. v. 2 v but v 6,!
