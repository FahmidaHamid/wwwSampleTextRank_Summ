 the rationale for the work presented here was therefore to study web use in context, as a means of updating existing frameworks of  web activities . to collect rich and detailed information about the participants and their use of the web, we aimed to gather data representing web use in a range of circumstances. we asked participants to do this for each  activity  that they used the web for. they also allowed for aspects of web use that are difficult to otherwise capture to be recorded, such as the use of additional resources and the context of use. this represents a departure from previous work, and was intended to underpin an analysis of  web activities  while taking into account participants  own categorisations of their web use. in practice, it was a useful resource for eliciting further accounts of interactions with the web, and getting participants to think about the different reasons underpinning their web use. the rationale for this research was to expand and contextualise current frameworks of  web activities , by grounding our data in people s own accounts and categorisations of their web use. our analysis of broader web use offers support for this view. by exploring the qualities of the web that sustain this plasticity, we can think afresh about how to design tools for users that enable them to appropriate web content for their own purposes; to weave it into the everyday.
