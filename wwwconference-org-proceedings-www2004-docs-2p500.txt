 a pair of web sites are said to be overlapping if their taxonomies share some concept labels. ontominer also has algorithms that can identify the logical regions within web documents that contains links to instance pages. as the crawler fetches the web pages, they are fed to semantic partitioner. for each concept in the mined taxonomy, instance miner identi es its potential instance web pages and mines instances, i consisting of labeled and unlabeled attributes and their values. we present algorithms to logically partition a web page and infer the hierarchy among the labels in the web page, mine the taxonomy of important concepts from overlapping domain speci c web sites, extract attributed instances and their values corresponding to each concept in the taxonomy.
