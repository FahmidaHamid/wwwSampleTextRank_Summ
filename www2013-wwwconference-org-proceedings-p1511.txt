 x is a block diagonal form (bdf) matrix if:    (8)     this is a bbdf matrix with 3 diagonal blocks. each diagonal block  xi in  x corresponds to a diagonal block di in x. decomposable matrix factorization. a sparse rating matrix is permuted into an rbbdf matrix (5)  rst and further transformed into a bdf matrix (9). lmf is then performed on the resulting bdf matrix to make rating predictions for the original matrix. the density of a matrix x is de ned as  (x) = n(x) s(x) , where n(x) is the number of non-zeros in x, and s(x) is the area of x. in each recursion, the algorithm checks each diagonal block di of x in decreasing order of matrix areas.
