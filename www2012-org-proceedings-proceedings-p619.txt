 nodes represent wikipedia articles and edges the hyperlinks clicked by the human.  path pos. to compute it, we found an optimal solution for every human game instance and averaged. click  based on optimal solutions for the considered human paths. consider an article u and a given feature. we divide the set of all wikispeedia games into subsets according to target categories, such that all games with target articles from the same category are placed in the same subset.  in 12 out of the 14 target categories, the most popular strategy is the one that consists of the target category only, which we call the  simple  strategy: people tend to approach the target through articles from the same category as the target. human markov model.  related to the target as human games proceed (fig. 6 (3,2));
