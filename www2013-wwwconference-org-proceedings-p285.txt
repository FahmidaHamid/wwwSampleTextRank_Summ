 all users in a have reliability 1, those in b have reliability  1, and user x has reliability 0. we next show an error bound on the estimate  w for user reliability obtained from algorithm 1.  (user error bound). error(  w) < we evaluate both item rating estimates and user reliability estimates. next we analyze the error in user reliability estimates. we studied the problem of aggregating user ratings when the user item rating graph is arbitrary.
