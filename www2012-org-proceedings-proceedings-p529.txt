 in contrast, our content spread maximization problem looks to add up to k new connections per node so that content spread is maximized. thus, each node shares speci c content with its neighbors only once. now f (s   {e})   f (s) = 2   1 = 1 since with edge e, content c from node 1 reaches node 2 with probability 1. assume that all nodes have propagation probabilities of 1 and content c is only at node 1. for edge set s   {e}, the content spread is 2 because content c reaches node 2 with probability 1 along path h1, 2i. the content spread for edge set t   {e} is also 2 because the content c from node 1 can only reach node 2.  content c  cannot reach node 1 because paths to 1 from 4 and is the content spread function.
