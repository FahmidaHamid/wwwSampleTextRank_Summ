 from here on, we will refer to measure  t s as the tree-based semantic similarity. the tree-based semantic similarity measure for a simple taxonomy is illustrated in figure 1. for each of the resulting 3.8 109 pairs we also computed text and link similarity measures, and mapped the correlations between these and semantic similarity. let us now generalize the semantic similarity measure to deal with arbitrary graphs.  the semantic similarity between two topics t1 and t2 in an ontology graph can now be estimated as follows: the proposed graph-based semantic similarity measure was applied to the odp ontology. subjects answered 30 questions about similarity between web pages. yet the applications of the proposed semantic similarity measure are broader than just web search. we are currently exploring alternative ways to approximate semantic similarity by integrating (rather than combining) content and link similarity.
