 the data suggests that group chats are a growing phenomena. the factors that motivate participants to stay with a group have been explored in [4]. we begin by describing three key properties of a group: we empirically validated that a typical group chat resembles a well-behaved group chat. then, algorithm 1  will accept this chat as a group chat. group chats analysis: next we describe how we found the group chats. most group chat hashtags have a weekly period (80% of the chats). for 95% of the group chats, we could categorize the group and a breakdown appears in table 1. in this group, participants derive value from the discussion. group chats over time: finally, we ask if group chats are a growing or shrinking phenomenon on twitter. limitations: while our methods do indeed  nd group chats, we know that there are some group chats that we miss. previous studies of group formation [2] suggest that groups grow by the number of friends one has in the group.
