 a higher value of ul indicates the greater reliability of the group.   l here the group observation model on each object depends on two factors: (1) the speci c reliability rl,m on this object, which aims to reveal the differences between reliable and unreliable observations on an object, and (2) the true value tm for the object. this is why we need more groups to capture the source dependency based on their observations on different objects. in the following, we will discuss the group observations models on each object. here, all member sources in the same group share the same observation model to capture their dependency. therefore, the group observation model should have  (0) no larger than  (0), i.e.,  (0)    (0). model voting after that point, it deteriorates as the model gradually stops capturing the source dependency with increased  . group i
