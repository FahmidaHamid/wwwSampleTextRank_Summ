 many clustering cf models utilize user clusters [29], item clusters [23], or co-clusters [9] to design cf algorithms. in these models, each user or item can only belong to a single cluster. users can then be re-clustered based on the number of items in each item cluster they rated, and items can similarly be re-clustered based on the number of user in each user cluster that rated them. (11), we just consider of those correlated users and items   an item could be a candidate recommendation item for a user if and only if they both belong to one or more subgroups.  set of songs and users by restricting that each song has been listened by more than 30 users and each user has listened more than 50 songs. # of users # of items # of ratings # of ratings per user # of ratings per item recommendation base performance method  each user or item can belong to. its user-item data is not user speci ed ratings.
