  exist in it ("dependency types" and "entity types" in [2]). this is modeled by a mandatory dependency between the services and the related applications as illustrated in figure1. that dependency will be automatically instantiated during runtime, without losing context or having to deploy the model. having it exempts the user from defining an obvious dependency and giving it as input. if such an instance exists, the entity is added to that instance as defined by the abstract dependency. the solution is defining an abstract dependency (a template) between entities.
