 in simplelca, each source s has a probability of being honest, hs. in guesslca, a source has a probability of knowing and telling the truth, hs. thus, with probability hs, it asserts the true claim. in lielca, a source asserts the true claim c if it it is both honest and knows the answer (with probability hsd). our priors remained the same as before, except that the claim priors followed the distribution of the number of revisions a claim was present in, rather than the number of sources asserting it, as per [13]. claims per source
