 from this distribution we can reconstruct a distribution on pages. our host-aggregated random walk is not equivalent to pagerank. pagerank quanti es the importance of web pages. we concentrate on the case where t denotes pagerank and the partitioning of web pages is according to their host. we measured the correlation between pagerank and the u-model using a sample of 1298 pages. departing from a page in our model consists of a random transition to another page of the same host, followed by a pagerank-like step from that page.
