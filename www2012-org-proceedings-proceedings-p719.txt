 so, the name of a target entity appearing in a document does not necessarily mean it refers to the target entity. an entity name can appear in a document multiple times. if a mention has similar context with many true mentions, it is likely a true mention. we discuss how we compute the context similarity between two candidate mentions. this can happen when an entity has many domain-external mentions with similar context. in this section, we discuss how to leverage three sorts of prior knowledge: entity similarity, entity attributes and reference pages. where ai is the authentic document for entity ei. we build the mention graph from the input entity list, documents and candidate mentions.  book sloan n=# entity, k=# mention, #edge - in mention graph that reduces the spurious high context similarities caused by many occurrences of the entity name in the context of a false mention.
