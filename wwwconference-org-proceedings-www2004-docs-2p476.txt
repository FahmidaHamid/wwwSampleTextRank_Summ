 the sentinel manager s central role in our web change monitoring system mandates ef cient processing of sentinels to ensure system scalability. we now consider the challenges of a web document monitoring system. content changes include any change to text and changes to hyperlinks or images. the implementation of sentinels in our web change monitoring system is as a sentinel manager, which is responsible for processing sentinel queries. preprocessing depending on the type of sentinel and the cost, documents may have signatures created to shortcut processing when no change occurs. structure sentinels. group processing begins when the sentinel manager is triggered to check for changes that affect the group. if none of the sentinels in this subgroup detects a change, no further processing is needed.
