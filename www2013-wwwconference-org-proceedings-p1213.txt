 by our de nition [6], a user session is a sequence of user search activities, including user queries, clicks on the search results and so on. a session ends when the user becomes inactive for 30 minutes or more. users are anonymized by given a randomly generated user id for each user. this type of behavior is performed before a user seeing the search result of the current query. c. user s engagement in search. by studying the three types of user search behaviors, we aim to answer the following two questions: 1, what are the temporal patterns of user search behavior when the search quality changes?   [a] average query length per user (ql/u): the query length measures the number of words in a user query.   [b] average query success rate per user (q-success/u: a user query is said to be successful if the user clicks one or more results and stays at any of them for more than 30 seconds [6]. to better interpret user behaviorial changes before and after the user was a ected, we select users who were only a ected after the third week of the experiment. we then examine the change of user query length.
