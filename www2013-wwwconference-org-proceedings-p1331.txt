 for instance, a user may selectively retweet sport news from another user while ignoring other contents such as movie comments from the same user. furthermore, we manage to model user relationship based on the implicit network derived from user retweet interactions, which we name as user social ties model. for each query (tweet) q from user u, we would like to rank all the other users v   u  u based on features including user interest match, user social ties and user s in uence, so that the relevant candidates occur above non-relevant candidates. to begin with, we aggregate a user s recent tweets. we make two assumptions in modeling user social ties. for instance, given a tweet, if one user can results in 3 retweets each by a user with 100 followers and another user brings it 2 retweets each by a user with 1000 followers, the latter user obviously helps it to reach more people (2000 vs. 300). 97,164 user social ties are established based on retweet interactions. similar to user interest, the coverage of users decreases 3.4% after excluding user in uence features (no in uence) from our model. we  nd that the best performance of the algorithm is achieved when all the new features, including user interest match, user social ties and user in uence, are used.
