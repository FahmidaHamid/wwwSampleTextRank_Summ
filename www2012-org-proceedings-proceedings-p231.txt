 following user of p. for more details of behavior pattern mining, please refer to [3]. then we can calculate the similarity between any two users by calculating the distance between their behavior pattern vectors.  noise user distributions on hyper behavior patterns behavior pattern vector hyper behavior pattern figure 2: the framework of our approach. figures 4 illustrates the distribution of time lengths for each user s data. both the hyper behavior patterns and behavior patterns are extracted from  hyper behavior pattern id
