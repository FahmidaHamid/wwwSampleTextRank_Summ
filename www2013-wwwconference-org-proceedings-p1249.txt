 the usual approach in question recommendation has been to focus on the relevance of the question to the user, that is, to what degree the question matches the user s tastes [21, 15]. finally, recommendations are selected by relevance to the user, matching question pro les to the user pro le. once a question has been answered and a best answer has been chosen, the question is considered resolved. the e orts in this direction can be classi ed into two types, which we refer to as  question routing to experts  and  question recommendation to all . we will discuss in the following section how user pro les are derived from question pro les. they showed that the prominent contributors for matching a question to a user are the text and the category of the question, and that user-user interaction does not improve the relevance of question recommendations [10].  question data is that it allows for question pro les to be built only once, at posting time, without any updates later.  deriving user pro les from question pro les. the more similar the vectors, the better this model captures the user s choice of answering this question. we discuss next how question and user pro les are used for recommending open questions to potential answerers. for question pro les, we  rst turn the three vectors forming the question pro le into a single vector. to evaluate our question recommendation system, we conducted two experiments. rates then drop o  as the tenure of the user increases.
