 there are m tasks, or objects, j = 1, . we say agent i performs task j if i evaluates object j. agent i s judgement we assume that an agent s pro ciency is an increasing function of the effort she puts into making her evaluation. consider agent i and task j   j(i), and a reference rater rj(i). , d  1 and task 1 for task d. then, the equilibrium where all agents choose [(1, x)] yields maximum reward to each agent. suppose the probability of agent i using strategy (1, x) is   and strategy (0, ri) is 1     for each task j   j(i).
