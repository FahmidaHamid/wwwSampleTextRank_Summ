 there is not a cross-lingual link from  anaerobic exercise  to any article in chinese on wikipedia. we randomly selected 10,000 english-chinese article pairs connected by cross-lingual links from wikipedia. link homophily. then for each chinese article, select the english article having the largest similarity with it to establish its cross-lingual link. therefore, our lfg model can discover more cross-lingual links by considering the relations between article pairs. there have already been 217,689 cross-lingual links of articles and 35,294 cross-lingual links of categories between english wikipedia and chinese wikipedia. table 3 lists some of these cross-lingual links. by using our approach, the number of cross-lingual links has been doubled. the missing of cross-lingual links means that there are corresponding articles within two languages, but there is no direct cross-lingual link between them. in this paper, we propose a cross-lingual knowledge linking approach for building cross-lingual links across wiki knowledge bases.
