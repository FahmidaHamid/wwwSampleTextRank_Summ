  (x,y) d in section 2.3.2, we discussed an mf objective (4) that did not make use of user or item features.  alternately, we could extend social spectral regularization [12, 8] by incorporating user features into its objective: just as the matchbox objective in section 3.2.1 allows us to exploit user and item features in mf-based cf, these new social regularization objectives permit more  exibility in exploiting user features in learning user similarity.  (x,y) d user feedback has opened up many new possibilities for further improving the scf user experience.
