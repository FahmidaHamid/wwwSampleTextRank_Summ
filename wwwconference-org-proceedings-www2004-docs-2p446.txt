 an interface description defines how to access the services provided by the object and how to interact with the object. our aim here is to embed learning objects into a web services architecture. using such a pattern shields the developer from architectural design decisions. however, it becomes clear that the ltsa is only a reference architecture, identifying only component clusters. the mvc paradigm forms the central pattern of our system. we introduce some patterns that explain structures and interactions resulting from the ltsa and the mvc. the factory pattern can be applied for manipulating a variety of related persistent stores such as the learners records or adding/retrieving learning object to/from a databases. the proxy pattern is a structural pattern that provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
