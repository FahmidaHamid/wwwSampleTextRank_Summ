 rich news then tries to find key words or phrases that describe the content of each story. by downloading the candidate web pages and comparing their text to the transcript of the broadcast, it is usually possible to find a web page reporting the same news story that was in the broadcast. the overall annotation system can be divided into seven modules, as shown in figure 1.  that finds web pages that report the same story as that reported in the broadcast. this system was trained on a 15 million word corpus, in which the topic boundaries were marked. this is not sufficient to allow the annotation of all of the bbc s output, as several searches are performed for each news story. we are now at the stage of having an asr transcript for each news program that is divided into sections, each corresponding to a news story, and some of which contain links to web pages describing the same story. (that is, those stories for which the story index documents contain annotations that appear to fulfill the search criteria.) once each story appearing in each broadcast had been noted, rich news annotator was run on each of the broadcasts, and story index documents were produced. results of the evaluation on 66 news stories.
