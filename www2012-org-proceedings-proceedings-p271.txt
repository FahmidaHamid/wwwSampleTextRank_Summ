 (a) illustration of data representation and factorization in rescal. creating such a tensor representation for rdf(s) data is straightforward. rescal can be regarded as a latent-variable model for multi-relational data.  number of entities  number of predicates   = 0   6= 0 moreover, we included suns [17], a relational learning algorithm for large-scale data which has also been applied to rdf data. data. in section 3.3.3 we brie y described how rescal can be used to learn taxonomies on semantic web data. a tensor representation of this data is of size 1519   1519   35.
