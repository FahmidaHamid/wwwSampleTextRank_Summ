 the attacker learns the four parameters of a tcp connection between a client and a server, i.e., their respective ip addresses and ports. the attacker learns the current sequence number, for packets sent from the server to the client. in some attacks, the attacker also learns the sequence number for packets from the client to the server. therefore, mallory (attacker) knows the client and server ip addresses, as well as the server s port. this causes s to open a (pending) connection with port p of the client.  netstat on the client side and observing the selected client port in the following connection. in sections 3 and 4 we showed how an o path attacker can learn the client port and server sequence number of a tcp connection, allowing the exploits in section 5.
