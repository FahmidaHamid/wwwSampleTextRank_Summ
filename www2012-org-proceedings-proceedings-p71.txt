  criminal accounts  followings. finding 2: compared with criminal leaves, criminal hubs are more inclined to follow criminal accounts. we  nd that criminal hubs  sfrs are higher than criminal leaves . then, we measure the mr score based on three heuristics: (1) the more criminal accounts that an account has followed, the higher score this account should inherit; (2) the further an account is away from a criminal account, the lower score the account should inherit; (3) the closer the support relationship between a twitter account and a criminal account is, the higher score the account should inherit. (the intuition is that if an account has more followers, the closeness of the relationship between this account and each of its followers will become weaker.)
