 this may be due to the fact that most site maps were hidden within the web site and users were required to locate the hyperlink to access the site map page before they could use the site map. also, users were required to switch between the site map and the web site when using the site map to navigate. in this study, the effects of these two characteristics of a site map were examined. it is expected that users will perform better with a visible site map rather than with a hidden one, and with a site map with hyperlinks than one without hyperlinks. also, it is expected that the effects of a site map on users  performance will be greater for a larger web site than a smaller one. participants had to find answers to nine questions for each web site. in addition, the role of a site map becomes more important when the web site increases in size.
