 in particular, the allocation of budget among nodes was not treated.   target-side in uence model   each target node t   target-side in uence model. our algorithm enumerates over all the solutions in p, where each solution is utilized as an initial budget allocation. notice that if the required budget ki is more than the remaining budget then the algorithm cannot extend the current solution. in this case, there is no use for allocating a budget greater than  with each target node t   t to  0, . , xm   x, and a budget b. consequently, if the budget allocated to the neighbors of t was b then each of the elements of et are covered b times.
