 the fragment detection process is divided into three steps. fragment based publishing of web pages improves the scalability of web services. we believe that automating fragment detection is crucial for the success of fragment based web page publication.  fragment based publishing of web pages improves the efficiency of web services. we believe that automating fragment detection is critical for the success of fragment based web page publication.  node buckets node buckets parts of a web page might be deleted or moved around in the web page, and new parts may be added. the lp fragment detection algorithm works on the af trees of different versions of web pages. if the node is marked as v aluechanged, the algorithm outputs it as a lp fragment, but does not descend into its children. all 75 pages shared one fragment, and we assume that the invalidation process of each fragment is independent of any other fragment in the web page.
