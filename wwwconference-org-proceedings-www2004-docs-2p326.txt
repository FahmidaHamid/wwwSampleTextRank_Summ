 the resource matching problem in this environment involves assigning resources to tasks in order to satisfy task requirements and resource policies. these requirements and policies are often expressed in disjoint application and resource models, forcing a resource selector to perform semantic matching between the two. we call this process of selecting resources based on application requirements  resource matching . existing resource description and resource selection in the grid is highly constrained. the loose coupling between resource and request descriptions remove the tight coordination requirement between resource providers and consumers. in addition to the semantic resource matching, the ontology-based matchmaker service (omms) supports dynamic resource discovery, and schema translation by mapping different resource advertisement schemas and encodings to our resource ontology.
