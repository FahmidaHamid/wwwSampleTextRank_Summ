 in particular, a user activity graph (uag) can be constructed for each application where a node represents a user and a directed edge represents an action initiated by one user, targeting another (e.g., user a sends a virtual gift to user b). user b, who has not installed the application yet, the facebook platform will deliver an application requests (ars) to user b, and user b can either accept it (install the application) or ignore it. the snapshots are then used to model how graph characteristics change with time [17, 18]. for each application, we con-  amount of users are active each week. this indicates that our model is able to explain the uag evolution of all applications we have tested.
