 implications on periodic transfers. if both conditions hold, we mark slots a, a + t, ..., a + (    1)t as  periodic seeds  as indicated by arrows in figure 3. a transfer consists of a succession of packets. in order to be periodic, a transfer must cover at least one periodic seed. subsequently, a transfer of i is considered to be periodic if and only if at least one of its slots is a periodic seed. what are typical periodic transfer sizes?  periodic transfer size (bytes) figure 7: relationship between   and periodic transfer sizes. periodicities listed below account for 46% of all detected periodic transfer instances. radio
