  all possible outcomes of a formula w that represents such a work ow. the formula w  characterizes those executions of the contract that satisfy the constraint  . the formula   |   denotes an interleaved execution of two games   and  . we must clarify what we mean by  computing  w    . in contrast, the formula w  that we are after is a work ow speci cation. (computing gs (w) and coexec(w,  )) and the coexec(w,  ). this means that those parts of w  can never be involved in an execution.
