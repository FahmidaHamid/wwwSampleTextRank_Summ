 instead, rdf queries are  ooded to the whole network and each node processes every query. this node is called the successor node of key k, denoted by successor(k).  successor node of the failed node will restore its replicas to its new predecessor. then n 6 routes it to the corresponding node n 1 (via n 14). this process will be repeated until the query reaches the successor node of h(ud). we also measured the number of neighbors per node against the network size. each node keeps counting the frequency of each predicate value.  and there are an average of 2352 triples per node.
