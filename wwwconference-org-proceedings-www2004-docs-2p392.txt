 ,  n) at time = t + 1.  where e is the vector of all ones. tables 1 and 2 compare the aggregation updating algorithm with google s current method for updating pagerank, which is called full recomputation since the power method is started from scratch.  time  time  residual for iterative aggregation algorithm residual for power method  residual for iterative aggregation algorithm residual for power method by the www 2004 conference, we hope to have: (1) tested this updating algorithm on larger datasets, such as those used in [3, 4, 6], (2) made progress toward understanding and determining the partitioning of states into g and g, and (3) created code that incorporates this updating algorithm with the other pagerank acceleration techniques.
