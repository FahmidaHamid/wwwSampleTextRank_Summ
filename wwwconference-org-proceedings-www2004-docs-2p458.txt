 then, the t-cnb searches for contextual pages on the same web site based on the topic graph for the user-speci ed page or pages that have been searched. these pages then become candidates for contextual pages. clicking on a title brings up the web page for the contextual page (figure 1 (c)). the t-cnb extracts contextual pages using a topic graph. a web page  may have more than one topic, and so, (cid:0) is associated with multiple (cid:8)(cid:0). we call the graph a topic graph. then, the topic graph for page  consists of two connected component graphs. our hypothesis for selecting contextual pages for page  is (1)the main topic of page  should have a high similarity to both of the main topic and subtopics of the contextual page (2)the subtopics of page  should have a low similarity to both of the main topic and subtopics of the contextual page. let (cid:13) and (cid:13)(cid:0) be topic graphs for a current page  and a past page  (cid:0), respectively.
