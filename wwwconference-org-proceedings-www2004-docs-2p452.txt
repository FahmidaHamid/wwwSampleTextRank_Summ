 more generally, i explore what page content and links say about each other, and what they say about the meaning of pages. the idea is to measure the correlations between similarity measures driven by content, link, and semantic evidence. these were divided into 106 bins (100 bins per similarity measure). figure 2 maps r and p as functions of content and link similarity coordinates.
