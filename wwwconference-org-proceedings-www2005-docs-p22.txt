 function pwi  denotes the new recommendation list, resulting from applying topic diversi cation. we applied topic diversi cation with  f   {0, 0.1, 0.2, . since topic diversi cation may make books with high predicted accuracy trickle down the list, we hypothesized that accuracy will deteriorate for  f   0.9. the two charts reveal that diversi cation has detrimental e ects on both metrics and on both cf algorithms. o ine experiments helped us in understanding the implications of topic diversi cation on both cf algorithms.
