 in our experiments, knowitall ran for four days and extracted over 50,000 facts regarding cities, states, countries, actors, and  lms.  knowitall is an autonomous system that extracts facts, concepts, and relationships from the web. thus, knowitall forms the appropriate extraction rule, generates queries, and sends them to the web. the assessor assigns probabilities to each extraction. when the ratio of instances with probability > 0.90 to instances with probability < 0.10 fell below a threshold of 0.05, knowitall stopped looking for more instances of the class.  web pages retrieved (1000s)
