 the qos of a composition is the aggregated qos of the individual services according to the work ow patterns [9], assuming that each service speci es its own qos in a service level agreement (sla). this has two main impacts on the requirements of service compositions. by leveraging our network model, we tailor those operations to the problem of service composition in the cloud in order to improve the scalability and the solution quality of our algorithm. figure 8: qos of a work ow then, we introduce the customizations of our algorithm that are tailored to the problem of service composition in the cloud. for each task, we randomly chose a number of those network locations and created services there. the qos attributes of each service were generated according to a uniform distribution. this is the current standard approach for the service composition problem. services per task
