 we begin with defining the notion for a property and then extend it to a sequence of properties of a path. then for any valid property p   p, the probability that   = p is given by (  pr ) p = = ^ ^ [[ p]] [[ we can extend these ideas to capture the information content of a  path association. intuitively, this means that a path is as this information is used to determine the refraction count of a path. for any path extracted from the queue, the next path from its list is enqueued.
