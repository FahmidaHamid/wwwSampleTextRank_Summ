 the algorithm s performance depends on the ef ciency of both the global and the local search algorithms. hence we should sample more on the smaller values for parameter i. the algorithm is described as follows: [smart hill-climbing algorithm]: we further compare the algorithm with other existing algorithms such as simulated annealing [14], and the random recursive search algorithm introduced in [18]. the random recursive search algorithm, as plotted in figure 6, shows some improvement over the simulated annealing algorithm. each algorithm carried out 1; 000 search steps. here each algorithm carried out 1; 000 search steps. the parameter ranges used for tuning each parameter are listed in table 1. the algorithm took about 100 runs to reach a high quality sample. the samples selected by the algorithm are shown in figure 13.  number of clients
