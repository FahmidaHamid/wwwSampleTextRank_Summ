 for example, if :p is a property, then (:p)* is a property-path expression that matches pairs of nodes that are connected by a sequence of zero or more :p properties in the graph. we begin by formalizing the sparql language and the of cial semantics of property paths. theorem 5.1 countw3c(p) is in #p for every property path p. the input of this problem is an rdf graph g, elements a, b   i and a property path p, and its output is the value ( ). in this section, we introduce this semantics and study the complexity of evaluating property paths, and also sparql 1.1 queries, under it.  jtk (path)   (path)
