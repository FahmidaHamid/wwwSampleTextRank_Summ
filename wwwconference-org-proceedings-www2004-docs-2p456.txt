 virtual classroom consists of two major components: the library of learning resources and course curriculum. thus, the classroom library provides learning content, which is then sequenced by means of the course curriculum. this can be achieved because, in our approach, curriculum customization is not based on curriculum alternatives, or sequencing rules made by authors before any learning session started.
