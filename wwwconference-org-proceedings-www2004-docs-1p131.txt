 figure 1 depicts a server replica. client replica on a client device is slightly different in that it only has the private mutable data for that given client. a replica in an arena can either be the server replica of an application or a client replica of the application. three participating entities, also called roles, take part in preference derivations: the client, the server and the application. replet arena s capability service maintains capability and profiling information of the client, the server, and the application. if the suggestion from the sih is to serve the request on the server, then the server replica is used. we assume helper classes are retrieved through trusted code repositories and can be cached on client devices and on server. replication a replet is intended to be executed on the server.
