 in practice, users expect higher level linkings between provenance logs to support drawing experiment conclusions. by identifying all the concepts in the page through the lexicon and the annotation service, the link service in cohse contacts the annotation service to identify target links to other urls with corresponding concepts as inferred by the ontology service. in mygrid project, for each experiment run, there is a corresponding  le which provides semantic information about the data and services invoked in the experiment. mygrid is working on building an annotation template which supports annotating with multiple ontologies and expects to improve the provenance model with richer semantic ability.
