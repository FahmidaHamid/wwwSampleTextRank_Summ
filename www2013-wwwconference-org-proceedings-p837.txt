 the model. top-k structural hole spanners.  technologies diffuse across different companies via inventors who span structural holes. structural hole spanner and opinion leaders. then those top users who exist in different communities are treated as structural hole spanners.  opinion leader structural hole structural hole spanner and information diffusion.  structural hole spanners. without these structural hole nodes, the connections between different communities would be minimized. details can be found in algorithm 2. and then those nodes with the highest numbers are viewed as structural hole spanners. structural holes.
