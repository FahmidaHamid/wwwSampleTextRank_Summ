 we refer to each recommendation of an url to a user as a stumble. for a user with k sessions, we consider a user as retained if the user comes back for the (k + 1)th session, and not-retained if we lose the user. for each session, we have the url being stumbled by the user, the timespent on that url and the session number in which the url was shown. user not spending enough time on the stumbles, could indicate that the user skipped the stum- for a user to like the stumble, the user  rst needs to process the stumble. for each url, we compute the timespent distribution of user s who liked the url. if the timespent by a user falls within this mean range for an url u being stumbled by the user, we say that the user attended that stumble, otherwise we consider that the stumble was skipped. we compute the z-score to shift the threshold for a given user as follows. discoverer features: these features pertain to the user who discovered the url. their results indicate that the number of answers given by the user and the extent to which the user was recognized on those answers (e.g. a tree is generated from all the clustered user sessions. this model is an interaction of url and user properties. further, normalizations of the timespent (user centric) and the url models do not help much in improving prediction of user retention.
