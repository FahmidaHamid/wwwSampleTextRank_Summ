 we refer to the proposed algorithm as discover. property 1: document coverage. the labels of the node guide the user in locating a document in the taxonomy. each node in the hierarchy is associated with a concept (i.e., the node label) and all documents under that node contain that concept. we refer to the proposed algorithm as the concept distinctiveness and document coverage (discover, for short) algorithm. snippets that do not fall into any node of the hierarchy, are assumed to lie in the  others  node at the top-level of the hierarchy. the users were not told which hierarchy corresponded to which algorithm. to design the proposed algorithm.
