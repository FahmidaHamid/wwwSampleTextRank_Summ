  this poster brie y introduces the travel ontology that is used for annotation within dante and presents how this ontology can be used to drive the transformation process. the annotation process is encoded in an annotation pipeline and the  rst two parts of the ontology play an important role in this annotation pipeline. the travel ontology is a controlled, shared vocabulary that can be communicated across applications to provide information about the structure and mobility support of a page. in our tool, the ontology is used as the controlled vocabulary to drive page transformations. sighted users tend not to read such constructs by skipping and directly focusing to the relevant part of the page.
