 our signatures can be used directly to monitor and (cid:2)lter p2p traf(cid:2)c. in the remainder of this section we will discuss the signatures we discovered for these (cid:2)ve protocols. clients (peers) store (cid:2)les and respond to search requests for those (cid:2)les.  of the packet is    .  the classi(cid:2)er fails to identify application traf(cid:2)c as such. we report the amount of traf(cid:2)c which can be identi(cid:2)ed based on only one traf(cid:2)c direction of a tcp connection, as a fraction of that amount which can be identi(cid:2)ed by capturing either traf(cid:2)c direction of a tcp connection. some of the missed traf(cid:2)c may be the p2p signaling communications which we excluded from our signature coverage. for this traf(cid:2)c, for each of the 2 directions identi(cid:2)ed above, we identify the fraction of traf(cid:2)c that is identi(cid:2)able based on signature matches with only packets transmitted in that direction. for example, the application signatures identi(cid:2)ed more than times more traf(cid:2)c than that obtained using the kazaa port. if that extra traf(cid:2)c could be iden-ti(cid:2)ed and removed, the percentages might increase. in particular we described and evaluated the p2p signature of the (cid:2)ve most commonly used p2p applications.
