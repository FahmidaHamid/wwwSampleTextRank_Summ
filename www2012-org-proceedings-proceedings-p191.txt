 they also do not study group spam. here we discuss group behaviors that may indicate spam. the larger the deviation, the worse the group is. the features just indicate the extent those group behaviors were exhibited. by no means do we claim that every spam specifically, we model three binary relations: group spam products, member spam products, and group spam member spam.  spam by a group on a product is basically spam by individuals in the group. a group feature can only summarize spam of members in the group over the set of products they reviewed. here we consider spam contributions of all group members exclusively. both of these inferences complement each other because group spamicity is related to both its collective spam activities on products and also its members. each group is vectorized with (represented with a vector of) the 8 group spam features. using these features, we represented each group with their average values of all the members of each group. this paper proposed to detect group spammers in product reviews.
