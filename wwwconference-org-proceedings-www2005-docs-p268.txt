 in this paper, we will try to sell you yet another query language for xml. these views can then be joined to produce another document. in section 5, we describe various strategies to evaluate xsquirrel queries over xml documents by translating expressions into other query languages: xpath, xquery and xslt. xquery [9] is the general purpose query language for xml.  in this section we present the xsquirrel language. we can then take the union (as sets) of the two, recombine them as an xsquirrel expression and normalize them. in this section, we present three evaluations strategies that translate expressions into another query language, mainly xpath, xquery and xslt. for each xpath expression, we evaluate the query over the document. another strength of the language is that it is possible to translate xsquirrel expression into other xml query languages.
