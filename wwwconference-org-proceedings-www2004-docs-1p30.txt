 we also give results for di erent distributions of cluster sizes and numbers of aliases. except as noted, for all experiments cited in this paper we used 50 messages per alias totaling an average of 3000 words. we split each alias into two sub-aliases of 50 posts each, broken at random. for each of the resulting 200 sub-aliases, we applied the selected feature extractor to the alias. the interpretation is that sim(a, b) is the likelihood that the text in the corpus of alias a could have been produced by the author of the text for alias b. using the benchmark described above, and using words as our feature, the algorithm ranks the correct alias  rst out of 199 possibilities 88% of the time.  be doubled without changing the measure  the number of items. we then tried to regroup the sub-aliases using our clustering algorithm.
