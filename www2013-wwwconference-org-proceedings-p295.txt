 a blocking function is any function h : e   22e that maps entities to sets of sets of entities. we call each set of entities a bucket of the blocking function. we assume that the entity matching function is given by a predicate   which is a dnf formula over such predicates. we call any blocking function with this property a hash function. the elements are the clauses, and the sets are the hash functions. a hash function h covers an element c if h   c. the weight of each hash function is its cost. before we describe the algorithm, we need some notations. for costs, we can compute the cost of each hash function once and reuse it in the algorithm. thus, we mate the cost of the hash function using o( n). we assume that each predicate a comes with a blocking function, h(a).
