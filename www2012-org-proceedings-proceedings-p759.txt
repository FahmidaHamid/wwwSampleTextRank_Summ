 indeed, question titles on yahoo! then, in a second stage, we apply a classi er that estimates intent similarity and decides whether or not to serve the answer of this past question as a new answer. only then is the question considered  resolved.  in case a question is not answered while  open  it is  deleted  from the site. figure 2 depicts such a detailed answer to the previous question. past questions that are similar to the target question, based on the hypothesis that answers to similar questions should be relevant to the target question. similarities between the entire text of each question and the answer are also calculated. finally, we look at the figure 4: the three input components from which features are extracted: the new question qnew, the past question qpast and its best answer a. algorithm assesses the best answer to the top candidate question as a plausible answer to the new question. the candidate answer is evaluated in order to verify whether it meets the underlying need of the new question. as mentioned earlier, a question in yahoo! in this stage, the candidate answer selected in stage one is assessed as a valid answer to the new question. to train and evaluate our classi er, we used pairs of the form (new question, past answer) where past answer belongs to the repository while new question does not. each hit consists of 22 pairs, and for each pair the worker had to decide whether the answer was relevant to the question or not. the robot also adds a reference to the past question from which the answer was recycled. we found that terms that are repeated in the past question and in its best answer should usually be emphasized more as related to the expressed need. for example, a detailed answer on the habits of gerbils may answer any speci c question on these pets.
