 in particular, we achieve aggregation via a characterization of how to splice a protocol into another to yield a hybrid protocol. protocol re nement. a protocol is re ned when it is made more speci c. this is an example of protocol re nement. a general protocol subsumes a more speci c one, if every run of the speci c protocol subsumes some run of the general protocol. these allow us to splice and aggregate protocols as shown in figure 2, where a shipping and a payment protocol are spliced into the simple purchase protocol. this con ates a protocol with the question of who is willing to play a role in the protocol.
