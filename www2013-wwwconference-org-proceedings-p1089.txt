 most of those methods, however, discard content information associated with graph elements. k-means clustering is then used on original graph nodes to assign them to different groups. their method, however, does not consider content information either. edge sampling has also been applied to other graph tasks. the graph composed of these sampled edges is passed to the graph clustering algorithm which partitions the vertices into a given number of clusters. lines 2 through 7 detail how content edges are created. for a content unit clustering methods? in our graph, nodes stand for publications and undirected edges indicate citation relationships. finally, we also adapt lda and k-means6 algorithm to cluster graph nodes using content information only. results of this method are denoted as  lda . 7http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/ 1093to the number of independent components within the graph [18].
