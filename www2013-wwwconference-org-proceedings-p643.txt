 the model based on these factor matrices is then used for rating predictions. note that the two participating entity types of a context can be the same: e.g., in the context of social networks both entity types are user. here un and um are the entity types participating in the context ll. in other words, information from one context does not propagate to another context. cmf decomposes the rating matrix in every context into a product of latent factor matrices of the entities from the two participating entity types of the context. in our proposed model, each entity of every entity type has a base latent factor. for each context in which this entity type participates, entities of that type have a context speci c latent factor. however, the factors governing users  behavior in the context of movies is different from her factors in the context of books. n and u l   every context ll has two entity types. also, even if a context is dominated by another context, the context speci c latent factors will not entity type user is the only entity type that is shared among two contexts.   inactive: users who have no ratings in a context, but have 5 or more ratings in the other context. what is a context?.
