 association rule mining. logical rule mining. expert rule mining. further applications of rule mining. a prediction of a rule is the head atom of an instantiated rule if all body atoms of the instantiated rule appear in the kb. a rule is connected if every atom is connected transitively to every other atom of the rule. parallels to association rule mining. we see a rule as a sequence of atoms. the other argument (variable or entity) is shared with the rule, i.e., it occurs in some other atom of the rule. this operator adds a new atom to a rule so that both of its arguments are shared with the rule.
