 how can workers communicate and negotiate the price with requesters? the mechanism interacts with each worker once in a sequential manner and adjusts the o ered price from past responses of the workers. the mechanism then picks the i and o ers a take-it-or-leave it price pt. based on the feedback from the worker, it updates the parameters only for the arm it. discretized k prices are used by our mechanism, p(cid:48) corresponds to the optimal price among these k prices. the expected regret rm (b) of any mechanism m can be expressed in terms of three components as follows: cost distributions. we started with mechanism bp-dgreedy for the bidding model and then extended it to our main mechanism bp-ucb for the posted price model. the expected utility of the mechanism m is in lemma 2. now, consider that price ph is o ered to every worker instead of p(cid:48).
