 it is futile to decide which of these is the best schema language for xml documents. xml schema is a w3c recommendation [22, 5] aimed at replacing dtds as the o cial schema language for xml documents. schemapath is a conservative extension to xml schema. this means that any correct xml schema is also a correct schemapath. the simplest example is subjecting the type of an element to the value of another element. since we are proposing an extension of xml schema, we need to grant that all the interesting properties of xml schema still hold for schemapath. there are some syntactic requirements imposed on a xml schema document that cannot be described by xml schema itself. again, xml schema and dtds cannot be used to specify such constraints. extending xml schema has several advantages over inventing a new language, or extending schematron, or extending any of the other schema languages.
