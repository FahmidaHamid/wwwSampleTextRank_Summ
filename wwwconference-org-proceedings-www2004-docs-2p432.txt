 therefore many training organizations tend to extend or enhance but not replace classroom training by web based training (wbt). for students the first visible result is the integrated training catalogue including both classroom training and wbt offerings.  training or test material may be provided anonymously, but authenticated access is needed whenever the information becomes specific to the student, e.g. in addition to authenticated access for students, tcmanager provides authenticated access for trainers, who may then inspect their time schedules or even deliver tutorial work from all internet access points available in their current environment.
