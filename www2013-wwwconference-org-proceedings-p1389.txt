 users can also share posts they read, i.e., they create a post in their own stream referencing that post. an interesting post may be shared and  reshared  in a chain or tree. they exist separately from the social networks they visualize, and a user needs to break context to go from a social network post to its visualization. below the visualization is a graph showing the volume of shares over time. as a user moves the mouse over circles, a  hovercard  appears, displaying post details (figure 5).
