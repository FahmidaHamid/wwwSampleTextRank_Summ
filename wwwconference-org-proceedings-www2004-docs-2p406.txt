 although content-based image retrieval (cbir) has been studied for many years [3], searching semantic concepts in image databases is still a formidable task. in our approach, we solicit web image search engines to do this job. however, the image pool may contain many noisy images. in our image database, we collect image cds which include lope, car and sunset, etc.  in this paper, we propose a scheme to learn web images for searching semantic concepts in image databases.
