 the lack of information about the outlinks of the un-crawled pages gets expressed in the pagerank iterations as incomplete rows of the transition matrix whose stationary distribution is the pagerank vector. but (cid:12)rst we de(cid:12)ne what we mean by accurate pageranks on a subgraph of the web. unlike the method where the unknown rows of the transition matrix are (cid:12)lled by a noncommittal uniform distribution, one may use the expected distribution i.e. the distribution of the state transition events averaged over an in(cid:12)nite time, which under mild conditions converge to the stationary distribution or the pagerank values. calculating the pagerank of pages in c followed by a single pagerank iteration on the incomplete transition matrix provides the valid pagerank under the assumption that entries in the unknown rows have the same outlink distribution as the converged pagerank vector. our objective here is to estimate the unspeci(cid:12)ed rows of the pagerank matrix t , i.e. the conditional distribution table p (y2jy1) and its corresponding stationary distribution r as the new pagerank vector.
