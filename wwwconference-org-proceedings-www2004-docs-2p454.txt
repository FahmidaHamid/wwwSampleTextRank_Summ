 the model can separate text data from the application programs, and enables various text handling operations to be  exibly combined. the operation executor executes graph handling operations whose inputs and outputs are a set of subject graphs. term vectors are widely used for formal text representation. we proposed a text representation model that allows a wide variety of text handling operations to be combined for realizing the complex analysis steps needed to discover knowledge. we implemented the model by using subject graphs as the formal text representation. a graph-based text database based on the model and an interactive knowledge discovery system were implemented.
