 however, simply because a review is duplicated does not make it deceptive. in this section, we propose a framework to estimate the prevalence, or rate, of deception among reviews in six online review communities. for the na ve prevalence from six online review communities. given that review communities are, in fact, valued by users [3], it seems unlikely that the prevalence of deception among them is large.   hypothesis 2 : increasing the signal cost will decrease the prevalence of deception. the framework described in section 2 is instantiated for the six review communities introduced in section 5. estimates of the prevalence of deception for six review communities over time, given by the na ve prevalence model, appear in figure 2. estimates of the prevalence of deception for the six review communities over time, given by the bayesian prevalence model, appear in figure 3.
