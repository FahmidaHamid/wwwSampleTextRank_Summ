 (in this, and in all other tables, document sizes are given in bytes.) table 2 shows the effect of parsing and unparsing of a document on document size. the results of applying such optimization over a whole document can be seen in table 5. table 6 shows the resulting run-times and document sizes for lower thresholds. the optimizations proposed here apply only to the markup; the text content of the html document is unchanged.
