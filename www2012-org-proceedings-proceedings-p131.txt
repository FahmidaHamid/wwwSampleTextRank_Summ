 this section presents the semsets retrieval model for semantic type queries. entity documents. this might be an indication that another semantic retrieval model would be more suitable for the given query, e.g., in cases when the input query is not a semantic type query. query analysis.  semsets model precision. we have tuned the parameters of the semset model on the  rst 15 queries of the data set. the query analysis provides information exploited in successive steps in the semsets model. the map of the result set without query analysis was 0.2434, that is in this paper, we have proposed the semsets retrieval model for answering semantic type queries from a semantic knowledge base.
