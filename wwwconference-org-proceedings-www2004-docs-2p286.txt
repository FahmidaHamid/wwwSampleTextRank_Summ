 before associating structure and content with each other, we will try to de(cid:12)ne them. the structure of a web site is determined by the link structure between its web pages. next, we calculate word frequencies per web page. we assume that the most frequent words de(cid:12)ne the content of the web page. the new set is initiated with the own key words of the processed web page. now, involving the site structure, we add the key words from the lc and accumulate the frequencies over the entire key word set. in the case of a homogeneous lc with topics matching the content of the page in focus, we observed no or only slight changes in its key word set. in this way, our approach can indicate whether content of a page (cid:12)ts to content of the web pages in its neighborhood whereas the neighborhood is de(cid:12)ned by the link structure.
