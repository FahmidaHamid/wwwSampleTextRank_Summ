 using computer simulations, we illustrate examples where the contagious network and the underlying network have very di erent properties. it may be a mistake to import social network intuition into models for contagious networks. here, we model online social network formation as technology adoption, and investigate how the network structure of the online social network is a ected by the underlying social network structure. in subsequent sections we will start with one of these network models, simulate the growth of a contagious network over it, and then compare properties of the contagious network to those of the underlying social network. these contagious social networks can be seen as a community within an underlying social network. the livejournal network can be viewed both as a network in and of itself, but also as a community in a larger network. at the same time, these results point toward the opportunities (and challenges) of developing techniques for reconstructing the underlying social network from contagious network data. then, based on this model, the data might be reverse engineered to recover  global  properties of the underlying network.
