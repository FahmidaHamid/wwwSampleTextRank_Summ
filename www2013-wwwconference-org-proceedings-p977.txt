 this query retrieves persons that are writers or surfers and were born later than 1950. according to the sparql grammar,5 a sparql select query can be regarded as consisting of three parts: let var be the set of all variables that can be used in a sparql query. to each projection variable of the query. for example, no query in the benchmark was verbalized in more than 2s. gates solution modi ers alter the order in which the results of the sparql query are presented to the user. yielding the query returns results between number 2 and 5. in order not to construct the query returns results between number this leads to query verbalizations of the general form this query retrieves. for example: namespace stands for the namespace of the properties used in a sparql query. from these answers, those which would actually be returned by the query had to be selected. these triples were generated as follows: we  rst executed the sparql query and randomly selected up to  ve results from the query answer. this procedure is repeated until the query returns results not returned by the original query. this task is similar to task 2, with the di erence that the natural language verbalizations of the sparql query and a verbalization of the triples were presented, instead of the query and the triples themselves.
