 the same search process can continue in the remaining results pages until the user leaves. then, when the user indicates that they d like to view more results (i.e.  we illustrate the properties of the resulting document ranking using some toy examples. (16) we can calculate the value of ranking document 1  rst as = 1  when we rank document 2 at result page 1. now, suppose that there are three documents and the search system must choose two documents at each result page. in this paper we have considered how to optimally solve the problem of utilising relevance feedback to improve a search ranking over two or more result pages.
