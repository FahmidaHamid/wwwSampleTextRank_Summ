 for example, in the social network analysis, a vertex with higher centrality can be viewed as a more important vertex than a vertex with lower centrality. the betweenness centrality of a vertex in a graph is a measure for the participation of the vertex in the shortest paths in the graph. [23] and [25] adopt the betweenness centrality for detecting communities in a social network.  we compute the betweenness centrality only on the  rst set of vertices. in section 2, related works on betweenness centrality are reviewed. they [2] also suggest an algorithm to compute the betweenness centrality of a single vertex in time faster than computing the betweenness of all vertices. betweenness centrality is a measure that computes the relative importance of a vertex in a graph. through the analysis of possible changes in the betweenness centrality that can occur as a result of graph updates, we discovered the characteristics of the sets of vertices in which the changes in the betweenness centralities do and do not occur. the betweenness centralities of vertices calculated using only the vertices in (cid:2) (betweenness centrality update theorem) by lemma 1 and lemma 2, we can compute the betweenness centrality of a vertex vi, c(vi).
