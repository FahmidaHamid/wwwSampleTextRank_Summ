 section 5 details our network size estimator. in this work, we perform a random walk but remove the requirement of exploring the ego network. both [14, 15] provide estimators for the total number of registered users in the network. we have   () = min {r | d(r)   }. n in this section we present an estimator for the graph size (number of nodes).   k,l   k,l  dxk n i=1 n network in this social network the friendship connections (edges) are directed. let  n be the estimator for n, de ned as follows:  n (cid:2)  n  n .  =  k,l  n = in this social network the friendship connections (edges) are directed. network network in figure 4 we see that the neighbor collision estimator outperforms the node collision estimator.  dblp network rw ego network mh ego network random walk  percentage of mined nodes flickr network rw ego network mh ego network random walk  orkut network rw ego network mh ego network random walk  percentage of mined nodes livejournal network rw ego network mh ego network random walk network
