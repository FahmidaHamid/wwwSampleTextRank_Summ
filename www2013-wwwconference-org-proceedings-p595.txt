 we can construct a matrix   that takes all users   as the rows and all items   in domain   as the columns. the rating matrix of each domain.   =   t +   (11) where   denotes the       factor matrix (it refers to user factors in our model),   is the       factor matrix (it refers to item factors in our model) for the slice   and   is an       diagonal matrix (it refers to domain factor in our model) for slice  . given the estimated factor matrices  ,  ,  ,   , the prediction of user  s rating of item   of target domain   is given by:  ( ,  )    t  where  t =  ,     ,  is the domain-specific user factors of   and  t =  ( , )  is the item factors of  . 14 and replace the rating matrix   with indicative matrix   for each domain. # ratings for each user  target domain: a target domain: b
