 the cost, or e ort, required to producing a contribution of quality q for each agent is c(q). u (q) is the bene t to this agent from entering with quality q when other agents play (p, g(q)).  (q) = u (q)   c(q) = n(cid:88) i also, since g(q) is continuous, the payo  at quality q   [0,  q] is  (q) = u (p(1   g(q))   c(q), where u (x) is the function de ned in (2). at p = 1,  (0) = an   c(0)   0. for each q in [0,  q], where  q is the unique solution (since c(q) is strictly increasing) to c( q) = a1. g(q) has support on the interval [0,  q], where c( q) = a1   an + c(0), and g(q) is given by the solution to n 1(cid:88) (cid:32) n   1 (cid:33) i i=0 ai+1 (1   p(1   g(q)))n 1 i(p(1   g(q))i = c(q) + an   c(0) for each q in [0,  q]. so no agent wants to deviate from (p, g(q)).   q = is nonnegative on (0,  q).   q = /  p by construction, g(0) = 0 and g( q) = 1, so g(q) is increasing and lies in [0, 1] for q   [0,  q]. , an) is 1 if and only if an   c(0).   p(1 g) . , an 1, (p(1   g))i 1(1   p(1   g))n i > 0 for q   (0,  q).   an on (0,  q), but when an   c(0) (so that p = 1), = (p(1   g))n 1   1 < 0. quality.
