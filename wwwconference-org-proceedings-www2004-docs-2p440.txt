 in this problem, one has a set p of positive examples of a particular class and a set u of unlabeled examples that contains examples from class p and also other types of examples (called negative examples). all the existing techniques assume that positive examples in p and the hidden positive examples in u are generated from the same distribution. existing techniques also assume that the proportion of positive examples in u is small. this classifier is then applied to classify documents in u to obtain the posterior probability (p(+|dj) and p(-|dj)) for each document in u. in classifying documents in u, those positive documents are likely to get much higher values of p(+|di), and lower values of p(-|di).  i (4) to the positive class.
