 the xml data mediator (xdm) is a tool for bidirectional data conversion between xml and structured data formats of relational databases or ldap. xdm supports the transformation between xml to multiple data storages (including databases and ldap repositories). based on the script and the direction of the transformation (from data storage to xml or from xml to data storage), xdm creates the appropriate tree structures for performing the transformations.  xml. a binding node is a special type of node, which specifies the relationship between a data node and an execution node. a node locator can either correspond to a cursor node or data node, but not both.
