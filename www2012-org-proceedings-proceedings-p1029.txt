 (cid:2) two contradicting phenomena. accordingly, a given algorithm produces core sets from some  nq(i) f (i) q(a)(cid:0){i a} a supp(q)     (1) where q is the core set distribution over 2v , and q(i) denotes the probability that node i is in the chosen core set (for more details see algorithm 1).  (cid:2)  q(i)q(j) q(i, j) q(i)q(j)  n the node i will be referred to as the center of n + i . all the algorithms we have examined produce their estimates according to the meta algorithm (see algorithm 1). this is achieved by selecting a node and its neighbors uniformly at random (see section 3.3). matrix-scaling-rw: moves from node i to j with probability w(i, j).  node degree
