 that browsers use for validating certi cates. the not before and not after  elds of the certi cate encode this information. after a browser has built a certi cate chain it deems valid, it checks that the hostname the user tried to connect to matches a name in the certi cate. is unable to create a chain from the server certi cate to a trusted certi cate authority. error connections certi cates expired certi cates. since multiple connections may retrieve the same certi cate, we see more than one   per certi cate, and thus summarize all connections accessing the same certi cate with the minimum, maximum, and median of the   values for each certi cate. this suggests that 25% of domains causing an expired certi cate error renew their certi cate within a week of expiry. revoked certi cates.
