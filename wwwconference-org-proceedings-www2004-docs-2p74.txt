 this is shown in the graph layer (see figure 1). the graph layer defines an interface representing rdf graphs. the rdf restrictions that a literal can only appear as an object, and that a property can only be labelled with a uri, are not enforced by the graph layer but by the model layer. this allows the graph to be queried for e.g. jena's memory-based graph model simply implements the triple pattern matches by iterating over the graph using find. within the graph layer, it is easy to provide triples. an rdql query can be issued to an inferred graph, just like any other graph, thus allowing query over the entailments. an rdql query consists of a graph pattern, expressed as a list of triple patterns. this is also presented via the graph interface, so the model works only with that interface. the graph returned does not have to be minimal.
