 prediction costs are also low 13as the classi er is limited to testing only the phrases present on the given ad landing page. the classi er is trained on two types of features. note that these features evaluate to null if the candidate phrase does not occur on the ad landing page. a few approaches have tried to alleviate this problem by compressing the feature and label spaces [21, 24, 43]. another approach to speeding up prediction would be to learn a hierarchy or tree in label space.  itive label in the node, nk is the number of points in the node which have label k as a positive label and n is the total number of points in the node. rather than adding the label with complete certainty to the training set, we get mlrf to train on the label with a belief of 0.6. each label, in our formulation, corresponds to a separate bid phrase.  label matrix into memory. training data for our classi er was mined automatically from the click logs.
