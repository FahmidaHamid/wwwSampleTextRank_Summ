 an information system such as a web site looks more like a net.  and we can see that in the selected example the statements part do not alter this environment. after these experiments, we are now designing speci cation language. we have extended the language xml with logical variables. a variable can be read (=) or assigned (:=). as the domain of our speci cation language is xml document, xml elements are the basic data of the language. this means that all rules which can be applied are evaluated in the same environment. a global environment is constructed by collecting all assertions coming from each different environment  les. then using this global environment, tests are performed, producing error messages if there are some.
