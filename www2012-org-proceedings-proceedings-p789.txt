 we call them as stream sequences. ated using the (j   1)th update and the time of o[j]th update of z.  erated using the value of o[j]th update of z. when z is known, we can estimate an optimal o, such that p (o|s, z) is maximized. given z and stream observation sk, we can compute the error incurred by the stream. z t = [1, 3, 10, 38, 39, . once model computes z, stream parameters are re-estimated and few more such rounds of algorithm is run. quality is computed as the sum of (z v (m)   z (cid:2)v (m))2 over all times (months) m for which z outputs an update.  length of z  z length = 3 z length = 5 z length = 10 z length = 50
