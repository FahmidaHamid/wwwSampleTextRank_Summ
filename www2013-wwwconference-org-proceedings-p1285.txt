 by  xing the scale factor t contours are obtained that are appropriate for that scale. each binary representation for a label   at scale t may result in multiple regions emerging at a particular scale. at the same time we apply the reverse to the scale factor t, where incrementing the scale level s quadruples the scale factor t, while decrementing s quarters it. at scale level s = 2 the associated scale factor is t = 16, whereas at scale level s = 3 the scale factor is t = 64. a region can be visually browsed by clicking on it, after which our system issues an api call to flickr to retrieve photos taken within that region that are associated with the region s tag.
