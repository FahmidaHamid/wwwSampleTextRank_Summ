 we assume that each document i   {1, . document text is generated from a bag-of-words model, in which each word is produced by some node along the document s path through the hierarchy. the  rst term represents the link likelihoods for all links touching document i. , hl be the hierarchy nodes along ri. network? we can also isolate the contribution of network information to the hierarchy, by learning the shape of the hierarchy based on network contributions but not text.
