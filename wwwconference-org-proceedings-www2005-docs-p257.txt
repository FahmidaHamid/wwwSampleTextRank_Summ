 result caching has been studied in [25, 21, 22, 32, 38]. query execution: given an inverted index, a query is executed by computing the scores of all documents in the intersection of the inverted lists for the query terms. queries not covered by result caching are broadcast to query processing nodes. we can strengthen the result as follows.  # of queries before result caching # of queries after result caching  > 6 # of words per query figure 6.2: number of queries before and after result caching. zero cache size means no projection caching. cache size blocks / query this is brought down to less than 700 blocks per query by adding projection caching.
