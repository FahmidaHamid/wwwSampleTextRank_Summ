 semantic web is to overcome the shortcomings of the current web by making the semantics of web pages machine-understandable. the semantic link network (sln) is a directed graph where nodes are semantic components and arcs are semantic links. a semantic link is an arc between two semantic components. semantic link deduction is used to find out the implied semantic relationships between semantic components from existing semantic links in sln, which is based on a set of semantic link connection rules. two semantic components are determined to have a particular semantic two semantic components similar that have such relationship.  we only discuss the semantic relationships between web pages and leave alone the certainty degree of semantic relationship. to automatically discover the semantic relationship between web resources is the key to the success of semantic web.
