 all of these models are applied at the item level, i.e., they learn one model per item from the reviews of that item. the authors of [10] further extend the model of [3] to extract sentiments related to each aspect. in this model, each review has a distribution over sentiments and each sentiment has a distribution over aspects. the rating of each aspect is then sampled conditioned on the aspect and the rating distributions of the item and the reviewer.  item groups  (a) epinions item groups  item groups the flda model can be used to produce feature vectors for item categorization as follows. note that, the topic distribution of an item in this model cannot be interpreted as the aspect distribution of the item. as each review is written by a reviewer about an item, the overall rating of a review depends on both item and reviewer factors. the aspect and rating distributions of items and reviewers learned by the flda model can be used for computing the overall rating of the review as follows. inspired by this model, we can compute the overall rating of an item by a reviewer using the learned item and reviewer factors. our model assumes that aspects in a review are sampled from the aspect distributions of the corresponding item and reviewer and the rating of each aspect is sampled conditioned on that aspect and the rating distributions of the item and reviewer.
