 relevance is computed with respect to an article currently browsed by the user. to overcome this problem, we develop dlsh , an algorithm that pushes diversity into building buckets. relevance). in the case of dlsh, we reported the results of the four diversity distances proposed. as we can see, dlsh        (d) diversity@r, k=10 for each input article we generated four related articles lists each of size 5. the lower that number, the higher the diversity.
