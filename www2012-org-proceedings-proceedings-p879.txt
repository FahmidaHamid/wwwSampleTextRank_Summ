 we argue for using variational inference in section 2. lda to learn multilingual topics. each document has associated variational parameters   and  . in this section, we highlight the  exibility of mr. lda to accommodate extensions to lda. inference learns the topics across languages that have cooccurring words in the corpus. the modular inference of mr. lda allows for inference for this model to be accomplished by the same framework created for monolingual lda. all experiments are carried out with 100 mapper instances and 20 reducer instances. mr. lda runs faster than mahout.
