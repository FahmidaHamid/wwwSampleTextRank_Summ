 note that though both the viruses are above the threshold, the weaker virus is wiped out.  each  xed point to be stable (attracting).   1 > 1 and  1n  1 >  2n  2 (i.e. virus 1 is above threshold and virus 1 strength is greater than virus 2) in the second  xed point, virus 2 dies-out and only virus 1 survives. similarly we can prove the case for when virus 2 survives. simulations: wlog, in our experiments, we assumed that the  rst virus is the stronger virus.
