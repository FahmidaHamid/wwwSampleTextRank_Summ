 on facebook, pages are used by organizations to interact with their fans.  graph between users and pages, with the time at which each edge (page like) was created. the algorithm can be seen in algorithm 1. we only consider those columns j(cid:48) for which every user covered by column j is also covered by column j(cid:48). this communication time slows the algorithm down if the data becomes too large. we see here for the  rst m   1 pages, the adversary can like the page with all n(cid:48) accounts. we ran the algorithm with 100 seeds, 3000 mappers, and 500 reducers. problem p 101.
