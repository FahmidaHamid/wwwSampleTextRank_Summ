 that is, the expected in uence of player a under the distribution for (a, b) is at least that of the distribution for (a  1, b), and similarly for player b. , yt)   {a, b}a+b, containing a  a s and b  b s. a + b do  (a   1, b), w a,b m = [w (a, b)].  b(a, b).  b(a, b). i a,b m   i a,b c (cid:8)=  . it cannot be that i a,b lies entirely above i a,b m ,  b(a, b). thus i a,b m  i a,b we can therefore write i a,b = i a,b . + b , b c c .
