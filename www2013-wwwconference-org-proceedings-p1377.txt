 the proposed model predicts the probability of a user making a decision at time t, given that the user did not make the decision before time t. we denote this probability as the tenure-based decision probability. there are four types of utilities, depending on whether the system shows the item to the user and whether the user accepts the item. this feature indicates a user s aspiration to make the job transition to the item at the recommendation time. will the model predict a higher probability when the user is likely to transit to new job and a lower probability when the user is not likely to make transitions? the lower the perplexity, the better the model. (a) tenure before users make the job transition (b) tenure before users start to apply for the new job. an actual job transition may or may not happen after a user applies to a job. in each job application, the user s job before the application and the job that the user applies to are available. the higher the utility, the better the model. the baseline model alwaysrec shows all impressions to the user. instead, these transitions need to be captured by the user s behavior signals, such as job searches, job clicks, etc.
