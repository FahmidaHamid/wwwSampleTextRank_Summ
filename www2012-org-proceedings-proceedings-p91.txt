   it scales with the number of inventory categories. in this paper, we track inventory allocations in time and measure the impact of their price change on publisher s revenue. , mak( p)) (k <   is the number of inventory types). note that (2) is a constrained inventory allocation problem where the inventory allocation is controlled by the price ing this optimization problem turns out to be challenging given that the allocation process (ma1( p), .    log p   log p .   the design depends on the number of experimental variables (here, inventory prices) to be varied. role inventory 3 inventory 1 inventory 2 constant therefore, given the demand parameters and inventory capacities, average inventory i utilization, say u 0 i , can be obtained as   we model this phenomenon by assuming that in the case of inventory discount (advertiser is exposed to the lower experimental inventory price when compared to the pre-experimental one) the advertiser s budget increases with probability 0.5. sales agents: sales agents tend to keep identical inventory allocations from transaction to transaction with the same advertiser. however, when the price of the preferred inventory is discounted, its allocation tends to be larger. role inventory 3 inventory 1 inventory 2 relative change in inventory 3 allocation for bucket 3 advertisers figure 4: inventory allocation dynamics as a function of perturbations in utilization of a substitute inventory.  change in scaled inventory 3 utilization  relative change in inventory 3 allocation for bucket 2 advertisers we cast this problem as an inventory allocation problem, where impression assignments that are performed by sales agents in the process of sales are controlled by price as well as the current inventory utilization.
