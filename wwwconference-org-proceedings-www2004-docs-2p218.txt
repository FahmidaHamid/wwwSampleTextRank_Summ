 currently, different xslt stylesheets have to be manually constructed for different pdas or cell phones. in the setup of a new wireless application, different wmls have to be generated from these different xslt stylesheets by the xslt engine. then, different xslt stylesheets are chosen for the xslt engine to produce different wml documents for different devices. in an application setup stage, the content rule selector is to select a set of content rules based on the device information and the dtd document or xml schema from the pool as shown in figure  device the xslt stylesheet generator generates a stylesheet by combining these two sets of presentation and content rules.  during run time, the device information of a wireless pervasive device defined from wap header is passed to the xslt stylesheet selector as shown in figure 3. with input of this stylesheet and a xml document, a wml document of an appropriate content and presentation style is generated for this device by an xslt engine. when trying to convert a wired application to run on the wireless device, the major effort is to redesign and rewrite the presentation part of the application so that the content would still show properly on the wireless device. the presentation part of an application could be handled by different stylesheets to fine tune the content to fit different types of devices.
