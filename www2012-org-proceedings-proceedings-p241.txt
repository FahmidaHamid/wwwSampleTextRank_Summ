   how are social and geographic factors in uencing the spatial properties of youtube video tra c? we adopt a similar methodology, de ning two key measures for each youtube video: the view focus and the view entropy.  a view entropy of about 5 bits. the correlation between view focus and view entropy for di erent categories is depicted in figure 6: high values of view entropy tend to correlate with lower values of view focus. in this section our goal is to understand whether social sharing is a ecting not only video popularity, but also the geographic properties of video popularity. higher levels of social sharing, as well as lower levels, reduce the geographic audience of the video. evolves over time can be exploited to classify the popularity of a given video [7]. figure 15: average daily view focus (a) and average daily view entropy (b) across di erent days of a video lifetime for three video segments with di er-ent fraction of social views. this has the e ect of pushing up both the view focus and the view entropy. again we time-align the viewing history of each video, so that the view peak is on day 0, and we consider the evolution of the daily view measures, view focus and view entropy, averaged over all the videos. we have discussed the impact that video properties have on these measures, together with studying how social sharing a ects the spatial popularity of a video and how these measures evolve over the lifetime of the video.
