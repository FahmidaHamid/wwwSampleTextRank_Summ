 all of the anchor text in a document corpus pointing to a target document is referred to as anchor text document for that document. we also use the synonym anchor text summary that refers to anchor text. however, an anchor text summary may also include some text before or after the anchor text to better capture the context of the anchor text. we sought to determine the number of anchor terms needed to produce good query re nements by varying the number of terms allowed in anchor text summaries. we calculate the cost of each anchor text with all cost functions. this rank is then used to prioritize anchor text during query processing.
