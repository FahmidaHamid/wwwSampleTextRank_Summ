 unlike text-based classi ers, which must fetch the content of the page being classi ed, our classi ers do their work by looking at the pointer to the page, and need not fetch the page itself at all. to convert a url into a tree-shape, we tokenized the url by the characters /, ? the html forms a tree, shown by indentations. we consider the tree holding the items we wish to classify. it is rare for a site to have advertisements and content in the same leaves of the url tree. the url tree seemed to be a good feature for ad-blocking.
