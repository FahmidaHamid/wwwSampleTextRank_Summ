 in particular, object detection [8] can automatically detect what is in the image and where it is. image search by image: given a query image, the objective is to  nd images semantically-similar to the query image from a image library. ios that can bene t from orns: automatic image tagging, automatic image description generation, and image search by image. the wordnet ontology has been used to: (1) improve or extend existing annotations of an image [25, 3], (2) provide knowledge about the relationships between object classes for object category recognition [17], and (3) organize the structure of image database [4]. the root layer contains three general classes, object, oo-relation, and object collection, denoting the class of image objects, the class of binary relations between image objects, and the class of image object collections, respectively. we adopt the detectors in [9, 2] to perform object detection.
