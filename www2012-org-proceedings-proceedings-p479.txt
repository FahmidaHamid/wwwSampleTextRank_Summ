  this problem. the most common and well explored such model is the mallows [18] model. several other generalizations of the mallows model such as the cps model [23], the aggregation model [12] and the cranking model [13] have recently been explored. in this section we develop a new score based model for pairwise preferences, the multinomial preference model (mpm). the results shown for each model are the averages of the test set results for the  ve folds.
