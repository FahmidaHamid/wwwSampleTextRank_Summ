 to lower the development costs implementing collaboration capabilities, we propose the collaborative applications via data annotations (colada) approach. while developers enrich the application s source code with annotations to declare data objects as synchronized, the colada collaboration engine processes these annotations and accomplishes the synchronization.  model server hence, model manipulations can be recorded and propagated. to discover and synchronize each model, the collaboration engine requires an annotation for each root node of a partial model. additionally, the application model represents the interface to the collaboration engine which captures local model manipulations and replays remote model modi cations.  model handler  gravity model  model handler
