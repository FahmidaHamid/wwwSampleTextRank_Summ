 researchers have also examined the relationship between query behavior and events. researchers have examined previously how query volume changes over time. for example, we know what query was issued, the number of clicks on a given url for that query, and so on. for both the query and url click time series, we consider the topical distribution of the url or query. when the model stops improving, we output the surprises. query click prediction results are shown in table 1. query click behavior tends to be rife with disturbances (surprises). baselines temporal ssm models model selection query type query click prediction can be used to improve query suggestions to present the most appropriate suggestions at the time the query is issued.
