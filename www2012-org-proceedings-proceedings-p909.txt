 the basic element of our algorithm is an event. , lk from an event ei to an event ej. the process is divided into two main steps   propagation of the event in the at retrieving all similar nodes that match the new event, and then the application of the node rule on the event to produce the e ect of the event.  graph composed of causality event pairs. event extraction evaluation examines how well the event was extracted. the  rst represents a cause event and the second represents the e ect event.
