 [13], but none of them have incorporated the overlap time information in their models. observe that the probability of connection increases with the time overlap. where |e| is number of edges within a company, |s| is number of nodes in the company, and  t is the average organizational time overlap in that company. we consider the following features on a pair of users:   time overlap: the organizational time overlap of two users. we compute this feature by 2(number of connections in company)/(company size)2. for each problem, we consider two models:   2-features model: using only time overlap and company size as features.
