 to develop social search technologies.    v . this will result in a very fast search algorithm at query time. baseline social search scheme: the scheme is composed of an o ine phase and a query phase. ,(l h 1[u], dh 1[u]) >. the search algorithm is presented in algorithm 3. also, adding a node to or popping a node from h takes o(log h) time. this network had 411 > 4m nodes and around 70m edges. the resulting graph had over 4m nodes and more than 380m edges. then, for our s e i r e u
