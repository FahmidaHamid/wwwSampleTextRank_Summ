 we sometimes refer to this tree-structured representation of an xml document as the xml document model. we have evaluated the impact of several common binary xml encoding optimizations on xml parsing and application performance. our experiments have shown that there is some merit to suggestions that xml parsing and application performance can be improved upon through binary encodings.
