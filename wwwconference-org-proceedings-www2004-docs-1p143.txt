 apache 1.3.27 was used as the web server for all of the web benchmarks.  all web and thin-client caches were cleared before each experiment. it consists of a javascript controlled load of 54 web pages from the web benchmark server. among the thin clients, there are also differences in the amount of data transferred depending on the web browser used. this indicates that they were not completely drawing the web pages as they cycled through the sequence of web pages in each benchmark. a fat client places all of the web browsing processing on the client. our measurements showed that the thin clients outperformed the fat clients when using the pc client.
