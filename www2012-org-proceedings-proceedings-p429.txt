 each user a personalized ranked list of stories (that the user has yet to consume) that may engage the user to the point of commenting on them. on the other hand, waiting for more commenters to comment on the story helps in identifying additional users who would  nd the story engaging, but in the meantime the story will have  aged . several past studies focused on user comments on news articles.
