 in this paper, we study search from the temporal dimension. citation data of the paper collection are available. for example, a research paper corresponds to a web page, and a citation of a research paper corresponds to a hyperlink in a web page. we present a number of methods to incorporate time dimension in paper search. pagerank only includes the first factor, the citations that a paper receives. since we are interested in both a paper s current importance and its potential, we modify pagerank by weighting each citation according to the citation date. the system calculates the time-weighted pagerank (prt) value for each paper as follows: in our experiments a brand new paper s agingfactor is 1.  best citation  count we can evaluate paper based on its journal evaluation, or its author evaluation, or the combination of both. another simple technique that can be used to rank a paper is linear regression. that is, one can use citation count of the paper received in the past few years to perform a linear regression to predict the citation count in the coming year. this predicted citation count can be used as the score of the paper for final ranking. similar to timedpagerank technique, linear regression will not be accurate if a paper is published only recently, and has only a few or no citation. this paper studies the temporal dimension of search.
