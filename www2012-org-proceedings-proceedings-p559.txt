 agents trust their neighbors in the social network and may extend credit to them. each agent u   v has a budget bu   0 representing the total credit that u can extend to other agents in v . u,v  uv = 1. we call a transaction between nodes u and v bilateral if (u, v)   e and the payment is routed along the edge (u, v).  uu(s) = u v fuv(s) u v v v   fix a node u   v .  network s. fix a node u   v . for each node u   v, bu = 1.  v v for each node u   v, bu = 1. such that for all nodes u   v \{v . each successful transaction in which agent u buys from agent v adds xuv to u s payoff and subtracts 1 from v s, while transferring 1 unit of credit through the network.
