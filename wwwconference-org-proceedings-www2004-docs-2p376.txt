 implementers of ecl can use a middleware component called the ecl connector. developers can use these schemas to validate their implementation of ecl messaging protocol. the ecl extends the ims dri protocol to include definitions of the gather service based on oai harvesting protocol [2]. these provide all the necessary documentations for implementing ecl protocol as well as a java ecl package. for the implementation of ecl is very simple. using our java ecl connector implementation, developers implement service handlers for the services they want to provide and deploy their ecl services. several ecl gateways were instantiated to bridge the ecl network with smete, edna, and rdn by converting ecl to the corresponding protocols. ecl also deals with the interoperability of the metadata. practically, ecl can be used on any repository.
