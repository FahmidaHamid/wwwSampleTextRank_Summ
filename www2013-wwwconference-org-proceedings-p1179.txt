 our model is composed of two key features. for each account we looked at the relative standard deviation of bids within each ad group, and averaged over ad groups. we did the same looking at bids within campaigns, and within the account. we now describe the aggregate loss function across all terms in an account. there are three levels in an account: (1) terms within ad groups, (2) ad groups within campaigns, and (3) campaigns within the account. for each sampled account, we get all actual user searches for which a term in the account appeared, and then get all competing advertiser bids for those searches.  term ad group campaign indicates the model did better than the baseline.
