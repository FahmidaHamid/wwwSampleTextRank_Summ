 whenever a user clicks on a shortened url, some information about the user is recorded. ened urls that are posted by the followings of the target user. with known information the target user. we created a twitter user (monitoring user) who followed all the followings of the target user in order to access all tweets that might be viewed by the target user. we assume that if a url is included in the tweets or favorites of a twitter user, the twitter user had already visited them. anyone can stalk a target user by creating a twitter account that follows everyone whom the target user follows (if the target user is not a private user). we also proved that if an attacker knows some information about the target user, he could determine whether the target user clicks on the shortened url.
