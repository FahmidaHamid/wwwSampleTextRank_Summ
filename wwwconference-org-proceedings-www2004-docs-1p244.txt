 you would like to send out an announcement and have the semantic email system give out (or auction) the tickets to the (cid:2)rst respondents. our work is the (cid:2)rst to articulate and implement a general model of semantic email processes (seps). (cid:15) manager: the originator invokes a new sep by sending a message to the semantic email manager. our goal is to (cid:2)nd necessary and suf(cid:2)cient conditions for accepting a response from a participant. the key is to express the constraints in terms of variables representing aggregates on the number of participants with each response. manager may suggest changes at any time, but only once per participant. manager may suggest changes only immediately after receiving a response, once per participant. we have implemented a complete semantic email system and deployed it in several applications. below we elaborate on the challenges in implementing a system that achieves these goals. we have introduced a paradigm for semantic email and described a broad class of semantic email processes.
