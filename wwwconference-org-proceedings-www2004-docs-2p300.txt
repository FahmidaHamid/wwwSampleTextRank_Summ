 frequent itemsets, session clusters, or user profiles can also form a user model obtained using data mining. training such a network may prove to be unrealistic on large websites. to overcome this problem, a separate network is learned for each profile independently. the network of each profile is learnt independently with a separate set of training data.  that profile as input and learning the network weights that yield an activation value of 1 in the output units that correspond to the remaining urls of the session, and 0 otherwise.  + = url
