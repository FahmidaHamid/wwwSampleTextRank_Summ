 these counts also constitute a time series and can therefore be correlated with the nutritional time series extracted from recipe queries. from each of the six nutrients we obtain a time series as follows: for each day, consider all users who issued at least one recipe query that day; for each user, average the nutrient of interest over all recipes they clicked from a search result page that day;  nally, average over all recipe users active that day to obtain the value of the nutrient that day (averages are medians, in order to mitigate the effect of outliers).  for each nutrient s time series. while figure 6: nutrients by day of week. the plots are shown in fig. 7. patrick s day (3/17/12). fig. 3). the results are presented in fig. 10(a d). changes in diet. consider a  xed user who has signaled an intention to change diet on day 0.
