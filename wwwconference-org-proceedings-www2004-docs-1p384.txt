 cs aktive space represents our effort to consider these issues directly in the context of an integrated semantic web application. the content is mediated through an ontology [3] constructed for the application domain and incorporates components from other published ontologies [21]. cs aktive space supports the exploration of patterns and implications inherent in the content. for the purposes of this application we have used a single common ontology to express the data which drives the cs aktive space. the cs aktive space application requires that a range of content be available for use by the system. the push model involves a data source (the publisher) choosing to express its data in terms of the ontology used by the cs aktive space. although this interface is ontology and application-neutral, it has a number of features which give users the means to use the information presented in cs aktive space. through the user interface, a user may request more detailed information on an individual, including their community of practice. institutions which have research groups that specialise in a selected research area). we already have web services that can classify our research papers against our research area ontology.
