 problem 1 (max algorithm). these metrics describe how close the returned item is to the maximum item in e, while quality(a, e) describes whether a returns the maximum item in e or not. algorithm a = ab({ri}, {si}) is described in algorithm 1. a operates on some input e and returns some item from e, as described in algorithm 2. algorithm 2: at({ri}, {si}) operating on e then, it attempts to adjust the r values across the steps, such that quality() increases. the max algorithm problem is solved using 2   n
