 crowdsourcing approaches must provide incentive schemes to motivate the crowd to perform a given human intelligence task (hit). this approach has several advantages including simplicity and minimization of task completion times, since any available worker from the crowd can pick and perform any hit. our system constructs user models for each worker in the crowd in order to assign hits to the most suitable available worker. such pro les are then matched to hit descriptions that are either provided by the task requester or by analyzing the questions and potential answers included in the task itself (see section 4). the task of the crowd pro ler component is to collect information about each available worker in the crowd. the hit is about. worker as he likes the most pages related to the query. we observe that in the majority of cases, assigning each task to 5 di erent workers selected using the facebook page indexing the task description as query leads to the best results.
