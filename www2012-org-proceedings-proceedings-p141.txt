 predicates are matched against edges in the data graph, whereas bindings to subjects and objects in the query are entity or literal nodes. our approach. the proposed model is called the entity relevance model (erm ). entity relevance model.  we want to determine which attribute of an entity needs to be compared to a given  eld of the erm constructed for qs. the details for computing mappings between entity attributes at   at and erm  elds as   as are presented in algorithm (1). keyword query (kw). in the same way, we transform the structured query into a keyword query by using the concatenations of predicates and constants of the structured query as terms. the resulting keyword query retrieves all virtual documents representing entity descriptions, which contain some of the corresponding terms.
