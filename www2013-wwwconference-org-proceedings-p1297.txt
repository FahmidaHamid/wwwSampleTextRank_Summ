 we  nd that the dirichlet spectral gap is much larger than the traditional spectral gap for these graphs. our observations, suggest that dirichlet spectral clustering may be more useful in this regard. in section 3, we then compare the spectral gap using dirichlet eigenvalues to the traditional spectral gap on real, publicly-determined network topologies [18] that represent smaller portions of the wider telecommunications grid. we denote by   the spectral gap, which is simply the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of l. using l, the spectral gap is   = 1   2 d   d   1, (1) and the cheeger constant is h = d  2 [9]. we de ne the dirichlet spectral gap to be the smallest eigenvalue of ld. as l gets larger, the smallest   approaches 0, showing that the dirichlet spectral gap converges to the spectral gap of the in nite tree (1) as the depth approaches in nity. we see that the traditional spectral gap keeps decreasing as n is increased, whereas the dirichlet spectral gap does not.  dataset id nodes edges traditional spectral gap dirichlet spectral gap as in fig. 3, in fig. 4, the traditional spectral gap keeps decreasing as r is increased, but the dirichlet spectral gap does not. we further visualize dirichlet spectral clustering for two rocketfuel data sets, shown in figures 6 and 7. we  nd that the dirichlet spectral gap computed for several ip-layer networks is much larger than the traditional spectral gap, and is likely to go to a  nite limit as the size of the network is increased. spectral clustering using dirichlet eigenvalues yields much better clustering than traditional methods. many properties such as the spectral gap remain open questions.
