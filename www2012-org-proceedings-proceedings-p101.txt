 predict user-a nity to a new campaign by only using the campaign meta-data to begin with; the predictions improve as the campaign runs and obtains more conversion information. our model not only learns separate factors for each user feature and campaign, it also simultaneously learns a function that predicts campaign factors based on campaign meta-data. also the campaign factors vj should be computable for a new campaign. we address both issues by putting appropriate priors on the feature and campaign factors. if r = 5 and we have 30 campaign features, this reduces to estimating 150 parameters as opposed to 3m with reg. some remarks on factor. campaign representation. sometimes, we shall refer to the two folds of a test campaign as training data for the test campaign. this simulates a brand new campaign and our approach would build model for this campaign using its meta-data only. it learns a targeting model for each campaign using the past campaign data.
