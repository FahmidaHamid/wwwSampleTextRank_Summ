 we start by proposing a multi-aspect trust inference model. we start with the basic form to capture the multi-aspect of trust; and then show how to incorporate trust bias and four groups of trust propagation. trust coupling: fig. 2(d) shows the trust coupling operator, which means that if two users both trust another user, they might also trust each other. (a) comparisons with existing subjective trust inference methods. both trust propagation and trust bias further improve trust inference accuracy. when trust propagation and trust bias trust propagation models. the proposed matri integrates the trust propagation with two other important properties, i.e., the multi-aspect of trust and trust bias. multi-aspect trust inference models.
