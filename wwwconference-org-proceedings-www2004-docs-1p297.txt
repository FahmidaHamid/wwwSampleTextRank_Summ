 then the application server sends appropriate queries to the database or other sources. after the database returns the query results to the application server, the application uses these to prepare a web page and passes it to the web server, which then sends it to the user. the sniffer sits between the web server and the application as well as between the application server and the dbms. if it does not match, the application server will not generate the requested page. if these parameters are identical to another request that led to a cached page, the page cached in the cache server is returned. again, the request will appear as a different request to the cache server, although the content returned is the same. however, the request parameters may be used by the application servers to generate page content. for example, for the request to generate the page shown in figure the edge application server is integrated with the squid cache server.
