 in section 2, we outline some design principles for xml full-text search languages. when issuing full-text searches, users may wish to specify that certain search tokens are more important than other search tokens [23]. users should be able to use xquery expressions to specify the search tokens for full-text search. we now describe and illustrate the texquery full-text search extensions to xquery. this shows how an xquery expression can be embedded inside full-text search (dg10). we now illustrate fullmatch using examples. these items are used as the search tokens in the ftstringselection.
