 a wrapper corresponds to a set of extraction rules, where each rule extracts the value of an attribute (e.g. we refer to a generic extraction rule (or simply rule) r over the set of pages u as a concrete tool to build a vector of values indexed by the pages in u such that r(p) 2 p[fnilg. every rule extracts one vector of values from u denoted r(u ). we denote by r(u ) the set of vectors obtained by applying a set of rules r over u , and blur the distinction between a rule and the vector it extracts from u .  lk (u )\r lk+1, the probability p (rjlk+1) that a given extraction rule r within a set of candidate rules r is correct, and the probability p (r lk+1 ) that the correct rule is not inside r. expandruleset() has to decide whether the set of candidate rule should be expanded (line 10). p (v+  : : : p (v+ once set, the set of candidate rules cannot be changed without seriously revisiting the inference algorithm.
