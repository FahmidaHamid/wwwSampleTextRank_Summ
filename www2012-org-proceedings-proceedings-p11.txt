 we take two distinct steps in designing this system. this can also be interpreted as the need to the performance of the system. it was then followed by the system analysis that aimed to identify the controllers characteristics and choose the right parameters before deploying the system.  time (days)  time (days)  time (days)  dynamics of the recommender system and the controller. time (days)  time (days)  time (days) to achieve this, two main characteristics of the system should be considered. these factors would provide further practical solutions to manipulate the performance of the system.
