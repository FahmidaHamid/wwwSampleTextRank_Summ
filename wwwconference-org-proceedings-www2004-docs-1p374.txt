 this weight will be the node s initial activation value. the node that was just processed is placed in the results list, containing all the nodes that have been processed and are the result of the spread activation process. at the end of the algorithm the result set contains the nodes which are the result of the spread activation process ordered by their activation values. the node which contributed most for the activation of each node in the result set is also provided. when the user chooses to navigate to one of the nodes in the result set, the systems provides the shortest path followed by the spread activation algorithm to reach that given node. search results for the query  oohdm  four queries were made. that, the semantic propagation.
