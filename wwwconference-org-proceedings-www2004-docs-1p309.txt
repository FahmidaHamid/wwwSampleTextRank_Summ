 the pagerank algorithm [28] of page et. there are many other reasons why a page might be considered a dangling page. in any event we get a higher rank for page 3 than for pages 1 and 2.  might expect, but that page 5 has a higher rank than any of the connected pages 1, ..., 4. this re ects a principle that has not previously been captured by pagerank, since pagerank computes a score for a page based on the pages that link to it, rather than based on features of pages that are linked to by the page. in the example of  gure 4, there are four pages, with one of them being a dangling page with a link from page 3.
