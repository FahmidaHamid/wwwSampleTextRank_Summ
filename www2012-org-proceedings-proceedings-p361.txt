 our goal, then, is a comparison between the revenue of the vcg auction and the revenue of gsp at equilibrium. (cid:2) (cid:2) i  iv (i) and the revenue is given by r(b) = i  (i)pi. we focus on two mechanisms: gsp and vcg.  i  (i) (vi)+]. then vcg generates revenue 1, but gsp has the nash equilibrium b = [2, 0] that generates no revenue. thus, unless vcg gets most of its revenue from a single player, gsp revenue will be within a constant factor of the vcg revenue. as pointed out in [7], if in an e cient equilibrium no player envies the above slot (i.e. no player i wants to take the above slot i   1 by the price per click player i is paying) then the equilibrium is envy-free. let b be the revenue maximizing e cient nash (cid:2) equilibrium. now, for b , we will bound revenue as follows.
