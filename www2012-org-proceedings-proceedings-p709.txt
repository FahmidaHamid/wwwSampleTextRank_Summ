 since the global authority information is not directly obtainable, we build our model over two basic actions most osn members perform, both of which can be viewed as a local endorsement from a user a to a user b: (a) user a invites user b to connect, and (b) user a views user b s pro le. i on linkedin? , rather than  is user a more respected than user b? . in other words, user a can be modeled as making a payment in social capital when she sends user b an invitation, or views b s pro le. treating each user as a vertex, we represent the invitation data as a directed graph, with an edge directed from the inviting user to the invitee. this graph is referred to as the invitation graph. this can distort user authority estimates in a number of ways: the evolution of user vertices on the invitation graph can be divided into three stages. for example, a user may feel obligated to send requests to all the people she meets at her workplace.
