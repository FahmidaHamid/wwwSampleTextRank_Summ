 the  blog judgment  module tries to select only the blog pages in the collection, by using the characteristics of the blog pages. a page is judged to be a blog if and only if a sequence of entries that are articles for a day can be extracted from the page. even if such a sequence is extracted from a page, the page might not be a blog, because archives of bbss, chats, and mailing lists, and announcements of events can also include date expressions.
