 thus, it is more accurate to speak of the twitter graph as an  interest graph , rather than a  social graph . once recommendations have been computed for a user, the user is enqueued once again with an updated timestamp. ), each of which may evoke di erent user behaviors. second, we can vary algorithm parameters. a user recommendation algorithm should have access to all these features, but this is very di cult to accomplish given the memory constraints. in the new wtf architecture, user recommendations begin with the  real graph , which integrates a multitude of user and behavior features into a common graph representation. in our design, the real graph is useful beyond generating user recommendations.
