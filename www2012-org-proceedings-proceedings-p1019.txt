 the multiplicand is the number of di erent ways two vertices with the same embedding can appear based on the di erent link possibilities between them.        + 16       + 4       + 8 get vertices for the link. then we perform a standard comparison of the link prediction e cacy of vcp and a selection of other methods. to run our experiments, we integrated vcp with the lp-made link prediction software [14]. the  fth element is one in which a reciprocal link precedes the target link in the prediction. in addition to link prediction and link analysis for the purpose of network growth modeling, vcp can be used for link or vertex pair clustering. the vcp computations for the directed and undirected variants of both vcp3,1 and vcp4,1 are integrated into the lpmade link prediction framework.
