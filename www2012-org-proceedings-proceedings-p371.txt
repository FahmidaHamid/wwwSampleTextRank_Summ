 consider the bidding strategy singleround, under supply forecast error, (cid:14), and bid forecast error (cid:13). this is because the algorithm may have some bounded error as described by (cid:15) and (cid:15)0. the value of (cid:14) represents the error in the supply forecast. it can be seen that the budget has 3% error when no optimizations were performed.  number of auctions won  number of auctions won this can only happen for larger values of k.
