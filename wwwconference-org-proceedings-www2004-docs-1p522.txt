 to gather commercial web site statistics from the trace, we post-processed the request/response pairs. we also removed requests/response pairs that could not be mapped to a single web site. a closer look revealed that this is a credit services site and most of the objects on the site are cookied images. table 5 shows the same for web sites and responses. figure 8 shows the percentage of a site s responses without this header. and, on average, 34% of responses from each site do not have the last-modified header. per site, 45% of responses are uncacheable on average and 50% of web sites have  web sites by descending popularity if every web site is weighted equally, the average header size is 325 bytes for request messages and 230 bytes for response messages. comparing web sites according to their popularity, we see little correlation between the popularity of a web site and the header sizes of its request and response messages. as a result, the origin server for the web site requires fewer resources for provisioning.
